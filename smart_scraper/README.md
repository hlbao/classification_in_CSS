This folder contains various scrapers, including a text-based digital trace data (tweets) scraper based on the Twitter API and manually constructed scrapers for YouTube and webpages.

1. Tutorials for the Twitter API are available at https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tutorials.

2. Check the corresponding folder for the Python package for scraping YouTube comments

3. I also created a web scraper to collect and clean text data (political news).
